### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github!

I am a software engineer passionate about building scalable applications and contributing to open source tools to enhance developer productivity. My current interest lies in GraphQL and GraphQL federation. I work day-to-day with technologies such as GraphQL, React, Redux, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, and Python.
